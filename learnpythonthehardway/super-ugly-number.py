# Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.
#
# Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all
# prime factors are in the given prime list primes of size k.
# For example, [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32]
# is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given
# primes = [2, 7, 13, 19] of size 4.
#
# Note:
# (1) 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.
# (2) The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.
# (3) 0 < k <= 100, 0 < n <= 106, 0 < primes[i] < 1000.

# Heap solution. (620ms)
