# Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k,
# find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.
#
# Example:
# Given matrix = [
#   [1,  0, 1],
#   [0, -2, 3]
# ]
# k = 2
# The answer is 2. Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]]
# is 2 and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
#
# Note:
# The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
# What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
